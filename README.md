## Description

Ever wondered why the band Train didn't create a resort that capitalized on their name recognition and world-wide brand? Well we did, and so we did some of the leg-work for them should they ever decide to act on it. This site proposes to offer vacation packages that fans and travelers alike can select from which best suits their vacation stay desires. All-inclusive, All-Train, All-the-time.
